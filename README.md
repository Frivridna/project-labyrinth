# Project Labyrinth
A pair programming project that is a text-based adventure inspired by early command-line games.

The app has been generated using create-react-app. And uses the following npm packages that are not included in the create-react-app: 
- styled-components 
- react-redux 
- reduxjs/toolkit
- nes.css
- styled-loaders-react

The focus of this week was to learn:
	- How to make API calls around Redux using thunks
	-  How to structure the redux store to suit the data
	-  To send JSON in the body of a request
## Reflections
We enjoyed the thematics of this week figuring out a proper design for the project whilst learning more about asynchronous Redux and keeping the history of previous data in Redux store. 

We started out by building the logic, then moved onto implementing saving data in Redux store and making a loading state to display a spinner.

The collaboration was mostly programming together, but we also tried out making separate branches after we had established a common ground to be able to work on different components at the same time.

If we had more time it would be great to inform a first time player that their username of choice must be unique by recieving some kind of message from the backend. We would also persist redux store to localStorage, so the app data remains upon reloading the page.
